# React + Vite
*In this project I have designed and integrated Register,Login and a Home page
*I have also created Table,Header,Filter,Modal as reusable components to use inside the pages
*For validations i have used Yub and Formik.
*Error messages are shown using react-hot-toaster package , Whatever response i get from api those errors       are  shown . For login api and register api i have not got appropriate error message in response so i have given some common error messages.
*I have used axios,React-query for api calls for handling loading etc
*I have used ContextApi for sharing the user details through out the application named UserContext.
*For optimization I used Lazy Loading in addition i have used Protected routes.
*I have used react-icons for icons.
